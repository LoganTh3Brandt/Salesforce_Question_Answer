Describe the differences between declarative and programmatic customizations

Declarative customizations utilize the declarative tools that Salesforce offers. These are the tools that do not require coding to use, such as Process Builders, Flow, and Workflow Rules. 
Programmatic customizations, on the other hand, utilizes the tools that require programming to use, such as VisualForce and Apex.

Declarative customizations are easier to implement since they don't require programming. There are also a lot of readily available features with declarative tools that can be implemented with only a few clicks. However, it doesn't cover every case you may want to, and if you want to implement something not available through declarative means then you will have to use programmatic tools. Programmatic tools are more powerful, giving you more control over what you implement. The downsides for programmatic tools include that it is overkill to use for solutions available for declarative tools, as they will be easier and faster to implement. Programmatic solutions will also generally take more time to create.
